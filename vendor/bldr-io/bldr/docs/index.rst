Welcome to Bldr's documentation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bldr, in the simplest terms, is a task runner, and an awesome one at that. It was written with simpler configs in mind. If you are used to build systems,
you've probably seen some pretty complicated build files, and they were probably written in xml that is clunky and a pain to maintain.

Well, here's one written for Bldr using yaml (json is also supported):

For now (while im still working on the documentation), this will hopefully serve as ample documentation.
